1. Understand the Flow (Conceptual)
Before coding, understand how the process works:

1. User clicks "Pay" on your website
2. Redirect or popup opens from the payment gateway
3. User completes payment (e.g., bKash, Nagad, Card)
4. Gateway sends a response (success/fail) to your server (NestJS)
5. You verify the payment, update the DB, and show success to user
