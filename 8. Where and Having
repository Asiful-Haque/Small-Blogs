✅ Use WHERE                    ---------------    ❌ Cannot use aggregate functions
→ Filters individual rows before grouping/aggregating
Ex.
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > 60000;


✅ Use HAVING with GROUP BY     ---------------    ✅ Can use aggregate functions
→ Filters grouped/aggregated results
→ Applies aggregate filter over the grouped part 
Ex.
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000;


✅ Use HAVING without GROUP BY     ---------------    ✅ Can use aggregate functions
→ Applies aggregate filter over the whole table (as one group)
Ex.
SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000;
